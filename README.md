# Pre-work

#### Install Docker

Follow these instructions on the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) website.

**NOTE** you may have to have IT enable virtualization in your system BIOS for Docker to work correctly.

#### Get the Source Code

Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).


Clone this Github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/maxmelnick/analytics-python-intro.git
```


#### Start and access Jupyter Notebook

```
# change directories to the project root
cd analytics-python-intro

# use docker to start Jupyter
docker-compose up -d

# view docker logs to get the url to access Jupyter
docker logs
```
